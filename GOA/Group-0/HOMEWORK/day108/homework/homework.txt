Imperative programming focuses on how to achieve a goal by explicitly detailing the steps to take.

Step-by-Step Instructions: You write code that specifies the exact sequence of operations to perform.
State Management: You often manipulate variables and manage states directly.
Control Structures: Heavy use of loops, conditionals, and other control structures to dictate flow.
Procedural: Typically involves writing procedures or functions that contain these steps.
Examples: C, Java, Python (can be both), and assembly languages.



Declarative programming focuses on what the goal is, without explicitly defining the steps to achieve it.
Characteristics:

Expressive: You describe the desired result rather than the steps to get there.
Abstract: Higher level of abstraction compared to imperative, focusing on what needs to be done rather than how.
Less State Management: Minimizes explicit state manipulation and side effects.
Examples: SQL, HTML, CSS, functional programming languages like Haskell, and libraries like React for JavaScript.
