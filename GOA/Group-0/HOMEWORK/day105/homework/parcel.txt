What is parcel?

A parcel is a part of something, or a division. It can also be a package or a collection of things wrapped together. 
Parcel comes from the Anglo-Norman word for "part." 
Often when we use parcel to mean a part, we're talking about land, which is divided into definable (and purchasable) tracts.

why do we need parcel?

Parcel automatically tracks all of the files, configuration, 
plugins, and dev dependencies that are involved in your build, and granularly invalidates the 
cache when something changes. It integrates with low-level operating 
system APIs to determine what files have changed in milliseconds, no matter the project size.
