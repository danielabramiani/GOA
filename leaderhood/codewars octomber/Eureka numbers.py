# The Eureka numbers are numbers like this: 135 = 1 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 5 ** 3. Which means that we have to take a number and sum its digits raised to the consecutive powers.
# First digit to power 1, second to power 2 and so on... If the result of that sum is the same as the number itself that means that number is Eureka.

# Create a function which receives a range like (a, b) and outputs every Eureka number in it.
